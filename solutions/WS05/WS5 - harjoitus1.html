    <h1>Workshop 5: Smart Forms</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>In this exercise we will practice the art of DOM Scripting with JavaScript. Use the lecture-material as a
        reference guide side by side these exercises. It might also be a good idea to save the lines of code you write
        during the exercises for later use. </p>

    <h2>Exercise 1: Contact Form</h2>
    <p data-line="4">Below you see a simple contact form which has fields for email address and comments.</p>
    <p data-line="6">a) Write JavaScript code which checks the input fields when the form submit-button is clicked.
        Display the entered values with alert -dialogs. Use onsubmit-event on the form tag. Make sure that your code
        cancels the submission of the form if needed. Hint: See the PowerPoint -slides.</p>
    <p data-line="8">b) Enhance the code and write if-statements to check the following: the length of email address
        should be atleast 6 and less than 15. It should also have a @ - character. Check also that the comment field is
        not be empty and the content should be trimmed down to 50 characters. Utilize JavaScript <a
            href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp" target="_blank">String-methods</a>.</p>
    <p data-line="12">c) Should an error occur, highlight the erroneous field and provide some feedback to the user.
        Preferably by displaying some text message on the page, next to the input field. See the lecture slides for
        demo.</p>
    <form name = "myForm" action = "#" onsubmit="return validateFields()" method = "post">
        <div class="no-border">
            <label>Email address:<br>
                <input type="text" id = "email" name="email">
            </label>
            <span id="feedback1"> Please fill in this field</span>
        </div>
        <div class="no-border">
