    <h1>Workshop 5: Smart Forms</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>In this exercise we will practice the art of DOM Scripting with JavaScript. Use the lecture-material as a
        reference guide side by side these exercises. It might also be a good idea to save the lines of code you write
        during the exercises for later use. </p>

    <h2>Exercise 2: Membership Calculator</h2>
    <p data-line="16">Below there is a membership calculator form. It has 3 fields: Membership Type (pulldown), Years
        (input) and Costs (input). User can use the pulldown to select which plan user wants to choose (Basic = 10€,
        Premium=15€, Gold=20€) and then enter the number of years he wants to pay for.</p>
    <p data-line="20">Update the code of the form so that:</p>
    <p data-line="20">a) the Costs-field should display the total costs of the subscription</p>
    <p data-line="22">b) If the user chooses to pay for more than 2 years, he will get a 20% discount. Notify the user
        when he is eligible to get the discount, by showing a text next to form.</p>
    <p data-line="24">c) Should he pay for 5 years or more, he will get the normal 20% discount, but will also be given
        an extra 5€ discount with a special greetings text on screen.</p>
    <form action="#" method="post"  id="theForm">
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Create Your Membership</legend>
            <p>Complete this form to calculate your membership. There's a 20% discount if you enroll for more than one
                year!</p>
