<h1>Workshop 7: Using AJAX and parsing XML</h1>
<hr />
<p><br>
    AJAX stands for Active JavaScript with XML and basically means a way to request a script to fetch data from a file
    or
    an API and return it back to the script. Then we can utilize the data either by injecting it into the page as such
    or
    by first parsing the data (using loops) and then format the data the way we like.
    Chrome Developer Tools offer nice way of tracking AJAX calls as well. Press F12 to open the tools and click
    Network-tab. Here you are able to see the requests and responses in action.<br>
</p>
<p>NOTE: Ajax calls will cause security issues in many cases. Thats why I recommend to sign up for a free account in
    Codeanywhere.com and do these exercises there. Copy this exercise-file there and start doing the exercises.</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Parsing XML data </h2>
This page has XML data embedded into it. See page source, line 206-214. The browser cannot display it properly, but its
there.
Below you can also see the structure data.
Write a function called parseData(), which will output the quote and author tags from XML when button is clicked.
Hint: Use document.getElementsByTagName() function. See PowerPoint for reference.
<br /><br /><br />
<input type="button" class="button" name="Fetch" id="Fetch" value="Button" onclick="parseData()">
<pre>

    <!-- THIS IS HERE ONLY FOR DISPLAYing THE STRUCTURE OF THE XML DATA IN THE BROWSER -->
