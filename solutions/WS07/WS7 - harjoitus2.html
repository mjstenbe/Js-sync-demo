	<h1>Workshop 7: Using AJAX and parsing XML - Solutions</h1>
	<hr />
	<p><br>
		AJAX stands for Active JavaScript with XML and basically means a way to request a script to fetch data from a
		file or an API and return it back to the script. Then we can utilize the data either by injecting it into the
		page as such or by first parsing the data (using loops) and then format the data the way we like.
		Chrome Developer Tools offer nice way of tracking AJAX calls as well. Press F12 to open the tools and click
		Network-tab. Here you are able to see the requests and responses in action.<br>
	</p>
	<p>NOTE: Ajax calls will cause security issues in many cases. If you encounter those, I recommend to sign up for a
		free account in Codeanywehere.com and do these exercises there. Copy this exercise-file there and start doing
		the exercises.</p>
	<p>If you get "Blocked loading mixed active content" error, please check whether you're using http or https for your
		http requests. More info on this in <a

	<hr />

	<h2>Exercise 2: AJAX call to an XML file </h2>
	<p>Create an AJAX script, which will load the famous-quotes.xml file from the server: <a
			href="http://iceberg-cycle.codio.io/5: Asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX)/famous-quotes.xml"
			target="_blank">http://iceberg-cycle.codio.io/5: Asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX)/famous-quotes.xml</a> and
		inject the raw contents of the file to a div below (id="quotes"). Here's another alternative: <a
			href="http://quotes.rest/qod.xml" target="_blank">http://quotes.rest/qod.xml</a>. </p>
	<p>NOTE: The raw XML data looks weird on the browser. You can use developer tools to study the contents by
		inspecting the DIV.</p>

	<br>
	<p>
		<input type="button" class="button" name="Fetch2" id="Fetch2" value="Button" onclick="loadXMLFile()">
	</p>
	<div id="quotes"></div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<hr />

	<script src="./js/skripti2.js"></script>
	</script>
