<h1>Workshop 8: Parsing JSON/XML with AJAX</h1>
<hr />
<p>In this exercise we will practice the use of JSON in our JavaScript applications. Use the lecture-material as a
  reference guide side by side these exercises. </p>


<h2>Exercise 1: JSON Basics</h2>
JSON means JavaScript Object Notations, and it means that we will represent data in a format which JavaScript
understands as such. No conversions are necessary to use it.
<p>
  <button class="button" onclick="firstButton()">Display the first and lastname of the first employee</button>
  <button class="button" onclick="thirdButton()">Display all data</button>
</p>
Lets try the following. You can create a new JSON dataset in your JavaScript as described below. Then create functions,
which will run when the buttons are clicked.

<pre>

   var text = '{ "employees" : [' +
   '{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },' +
   '{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },' +
   '{ "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" } ]}';
   </pre>
<ul>
  <li>The First button will display the first and lastname of the first employee in the div below.</li>
  <li>The Second button will display all the data for all items in the div below. If you wish, you can use for-loops
    here.</li>

</ul>
<div id="jsondata">JSON data goes here.</div>
<br> <br>
